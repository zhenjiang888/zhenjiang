<H1>Project Descriptions</H1>
<HR>
In the following, we describe some idea of the projects that
under-graduate students, master students, or Ph.D students can do.
It is always possible to tailor a project to your specific interests. 
It is our hope that this could help you to find a proper research
topic fast. <P>

If you find something interesting, come and talk to us.

<DT><H2><IMG SRC="/icons/yellowball.gif" ALT=""> Mathematica for
Program Transformation</H2>
<UL>
<LI> <H3> Overview </H3> 
Mathematica is one of the most advanced and comprehensive
"mathematical software system", widely used by engineers, physicists
and mathematicians. It is so attractive because of its
comprehensive mathematical algorithms library. However, there is
an distinguishing feature that has not been fully recognized. 
  <UL>
  <LI> The avaliability of built-in algorithms for manipulating
symbolic expressions and, in particular, transformation rules, which
makes it possible to write one's own transformation systems.
  <LI> The possibility for defining one's own notation.
  </UL>
The main goal of this project is to clarify this feature and implement 
a small transformation system, say parallelization.<P>

<DT><H2><IMG SRC="/icons/yellowball.gif" ALT=""> Extensible Java</H2>
<UL>
<LI> <H3> Overview </H3> 
Java becomes hotter and hotter, not only in programming but also in
implementation. Pizza is an example of such extension of Java with 
several new aspects of modern functional languages. It would be
helpful if Java could provide an open mechanism for adding new language
features. <Br>

The aim of this work is to make Java be extensible by means of the 
refection technique. It would be pursuasive to show that  pizza's new
language features could be easily put into the entensibel Java.<p>

<DT><H2><IMG SRC="/icons/yellowball.gif" ALT=""> Implementing
Polytypic Functions in CRML</H2>
<UL>
<LI> <H3> Overview </H3> 
CRML is a reflective ML language, developed by Tim Sheard in OGI. 
To what we know, this is the first reflective typed functional
language. On the other hand, polytyism is a new abstraction features
over data type.
Note that CAML system has been installed in our lab. <BR>

The goal of this work is to add the polytypic features to CRML by
making full use of reflective mechanism provided by CRML. 
This will pave the way for further development of safe reflective
system. <P>
