Functional Programming, Workflow and Cloud 
Yike Guo (Imperial College London)

Abstract: Functional programming has been a subject of main stream
computer science for many years. In spite of its huge impact on the
development of programming language theory and practice, software
engineering and even computer architecture, it is fair to say that
functional programming is still mainly a principle rather than a
particle tool for daily software development. However, I would like to
argue that this situation may be changed in the new era of service
oriented computing. In last few years, workflow has been an active
research subject in the community of Grid computing. Workflow, which
can be understood as a graphical functional programming language,
provides a practical means for building computational services by
composing existing services. Some practical workflow systems have been
build and widely adopted in industry. This development has proven that
the functional programming is playing an increasingly important role
in service oriented computing. In this talk, I wou ld like to present
a new view of functional programming in the context of Cloud
Computing.  By presenting the technical challenges and the methodology
of building Cloud application, I will present a functional framework
for programming the Cloud by mashing up Cloud services.
